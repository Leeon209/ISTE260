        <p>If we had money, we would love to see our idea come to life, whether it be through a mobile or web based application,
            or inspire a campus-wide event where students can go to the 'Campus Marketplace' to buy or sell secondhand items. We are happy with the results of
            our feedback from our usability evaluations and if given more time, would love to see a fully coded, functional prototype that goes beyona our Figma prototype.
            We would also like to explore more ways to incorporate accessibility into our app, whether it be through adding more features, such as being able to adjust the
            display text font and size, or creating various UI layouts that cater to different audiences (minimal to good chaos). If this product were to become a successful reality,
            we would love to see this implemented in many other colleges and universities.
